This is a simple UDP ping created for a networked applications class assignment

The applications uses a client-server architecture which makes it more similar to a network "heartbeat" than a classical "ping"
as messages can only be exchanged with a server rather than in a p2p fashion as you would with a classic ICMP ping.
